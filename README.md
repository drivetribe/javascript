# JavaScript packages

## Rules

### Naming

- Packages should be added to the environment appropriate to their environment. React Native-only components should be saved under `react-native`, for instance.
- Packages should be published to the `@drivetribe` organisation.
- Package names are concatinated paths. ie a React DOM component called `image` would be published as `react-dom-image`.
